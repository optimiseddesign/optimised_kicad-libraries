Very rough intial notes to form basis for proper design checklist document.
Compiled from steps used for VRGOmini PT106A & PT106B releases around 12/2019


SCHEMATIC SYMBOLS


FOOTPRINTS
make sure all pads have soldermask clearance of 0.0mm (this is set board-wide in the PCB design rules)
set centre thermal pads to solid / full contact with planes
make sure F.Fab text does not have 'visible' ticked so they don't appear in fab drawing
make sure Silk refdes does not have 'keep upright' ticked, so can rotate


SCHEMATIC
major schematic blocks and important design items have schematic text to explain
titleblocks added & versioned correctly for release
make sure all expected fields have full info filled out (MPN1, Description, Datasheet, SKU1 etc)
make sure all unexpected fields are blank


LAYOUT
net classes & design rules correct
titleblocks added & versioned correctly for release
id & versioning silk
auxiliary origin in bottom-left of PCB
important pcb dimensions on Dwgs.User layer
layer names on each layer
all DRCs clear, or accepted
silkscreen etc tidied


DESIGN PACK
readme updated, incl revision history
export bom - use KiBOM from my own customised fork at https://github.com/kb-consulting/KiBoM.git using command:...
python "C:\freelance\git\KiBoM/KiBOM_CLI.py" -v "%I" "%O.csv" -d "..\manufacturing"
... plus custom bom.ini from C:\freelance\git\optimised_kicad-libraries\environment\bom.ini (copied into KiCAD design folder root)
... (later could change field to "Part Description" to avoid clashing with 'Description' and needed my customised fork?).
change BOM headers "Component" to "Item", and "Quantity per PCB" to "Qty", and left-align everything, move pcb info to sensible place, save as .xlsx with bold headers & frozen top row.
schematic pdf
3d render images front & back
3d cad step model (relative to auxiliary origin, or centre if that already used)
gerbers (relative to auxiliary origin)
drill files (plated & non-plated,relative to auxiliary origin)
position files (top & bottom, relative to auxiliary origin)
layout pdf - each page is a layer, in one pdf, with layer names (colour export)
REVIEW ALL OUTPUTS
tag in git??
save in project/other dir??
ECN / record release??


+ adjustments for JLC PCB or other manufacturer data?
+ ideas from enmodus stuff
